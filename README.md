# ToDoApp

A simple to-do-list app, that uses tkinter and gives basic functionalities(yet). It's still work under progress. But it supports adding of a task, viewing of previous undone tasks and viewing progress of your daily tasks and much more! 

Either download the exe of the app or run the code with required files placed correctly(might want to use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the extra modules).
Testing on Windows 10 on progress. Not yet tested on macOS.

Yes, completely made using tkinter for GUI and sqlite3 to store the data. Go on, try the exe for Windows 10 [here](https://github.com/nihaalnz/ToDoApp/releases/tag/BV2).

Thanks for using this app :)
