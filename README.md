# ToDoApp

A simple to-do-list app, that uses tkinter and gives basic functionalities. Its still work under progress. But it supports adding of a task, seeing of previous undone tasks and viewing progress of your daily tasks and much more.

Either download the exe of the app or run the code with required files placed correctly(might want to use `pip install -r rquirements.txt` to install all extra modules)
Testing on Windows 10 on progress. Not yet tested on macOS.

Thanks for using this app.
